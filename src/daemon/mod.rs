//! Local daemon mode for shared SSH pool across CLI invocations.
//!
//! When running as a daemon, the bridge spawns a single long-lived
//! [`McpServer`] process that listens on a Unix domain socket at
//! `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mcp-ssh-bridge.sock` (fallback:
//! `/tmp/mcp-ssh-bridge-$UID.sock`). CLI invocations detect the socket,
//! connect, and forward their `tools/call` requests over JSON-RPC. The
//! shared `McpServer` connection pool keeps SSH handshakes cached
//! between invocations.
//!
//! # Sprint 3 — Transport unified
//!
//! The daemon now plugs a [`UnixSocketTransport`] into the generic
//! [`McpServer::serve`] accept loop, just like stdio mode plugs in
//! [`crate::mcp::transport::stdio::StdioTransport`]. Consequences:
//!
//! - **Elicitation, sampling, and logging** work end-to-end in daemon
//!   mode because `serve_session` wires a per-session
//!   `notification_tx` into every `ToolContext`.
//! - **Batch requests** work because the batch dispatcher is shared
//!   with stdio.
//! - **Config hot-reload** works because `ConfigWatcher` is spawned by
//!   `serve<T>()` and broadcasts `tools/list_changed` notifications
//!   through the same channel each client session listens on.
//!
//! The old per-connection handler that lived in `daemon/connection.rs`
//! is gone: its job is now done by `McpServer::serve_session`, which
//! already has the cancellation plumbing, the request registry, and
//! the full dispatch surface.
