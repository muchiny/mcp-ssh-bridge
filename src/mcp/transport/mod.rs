//! MCP Transport Layer
//!
//! Abstracts the transport mechanism behind a common session-based trait.
//!
//! The [`Transport`] trait is a **listener abstraction**: each call to
//! [`Transport::accept`] returns the next client session. Implementations
//! can be:
//!
//! - **Single-session** (e.g. [`stdio::StdioTransport`]): the first
//!   `accept()` returns a `Session` bound to stdin/stdout; subsequent
//!   calls return `None`, ending the accept loop.
//! - **Multi-session** (e.g. [`unix_socket::UnixSocketTransport`]): each
//!   `accept()` returns a fresh session corresponding to one client
//!   connection on the Unix socket.
//!
//! Each [`Session`] exposes a `reader` (incoming JSON-RPC messages) and a
//! `writer` (outgoing responses + server-initiated notifications). The
//! session reader/writer are split so the writer can be moved into a
//! dedicated background task while the main loop drives the reader — this
//! lets us use a per-session `mpsc::Sender<WriterMessage>` for
//! server-to-client notifications (elicitation, sampling, logging) that
//! are scoped to the originating connection.
//!
//! See [`crate::mcp::server::McpServer::serve`] for the generic accept
//! loop that consumes any `Transport` implementation.
