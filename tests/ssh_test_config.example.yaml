# SSH Integration Test Configuration Template
#
# Copy this file to tests/ssh_test_config.yaml and fill with real values.
# The actual config file is gitignored - never commit real credentials.
#
# Run integration tests with:
#   cargo test --test ssh_integration -- --ignored
#   cargo test --test sftp_integration -- --ignored

ssh_test:
  # SSH connection details
  hostname: "192.168.x.x"     # IP address or hostname
  port: 22
  user: "pi"                  # SSH username

  auth:
    # Option 1: SSH key (recommended)
    key:
