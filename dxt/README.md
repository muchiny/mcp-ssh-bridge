# 📦 MCP SSH Bridge — DXT Package

## 🤔 What Is DXT?

**DXT (Desktop Extension)** is Claude Desktop's one-click install format for MCP servers. A `.dxt` file is a ZIP archive containing a binary, a manifest, and an icon that Claude Desktop can install directly — no manual configuration needed.

When a user opens a `.dxt` file, Claude Desktop automatically:
1. Extracts the binary to its extensions directory
2. Reads the manifest to register the MCP server
3. Makes all tools available immediately via stdio transport

## 🔨 How to Build

Build the DXT package using the Makefile:

```bash
make dxt
```

This runs the following steps:
1. Builds an optimized release binary (`make release`)
2. Creates `dist/dxt/` directory
3. Copies the release binary, `manifest.json`, and `icon.svg` into it
4. Zips the directory into `dist/mcp-ssh-bridge.dxt`

The output package is at:
```
dist/mcp-ssh-bridge.dxt
```

## 🏗️ Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture |
|----------|-------------|
| Linux | x86_64, ARM64 |
| macOS | x86_64 (Intel), ARM64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Windows | x86_64 |

> **Note:** The `make dxt` command builds for the current host platform. To produce packages for other platforms, cross-compile the binary first (e.g., using `make release-target TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) and then assemble the DXT package manually.
